# Ukraine Regions Game

This is a quiz game where you name whatever regions you remember and if you've guessed the name right it will be added on the map. Names of regions that you haven't guessed yet are written into a separate file "regions_to_learn.csv".

I made this project during the "100 Days of Code" course. I made it for personal use which is why it's in Russian. I do not plan to translate it or make changes to it.

The project utilizes Turtle for a simple GUI and Pandas to handle csv files.
Run main.py to start the program.
