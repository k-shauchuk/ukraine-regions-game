# Ukraine Regions Game

This is a project I've made during the "100 Days of Code" course. I made it for personal use which is why it's in Russian. I do not plan to translate it or make changes to it.

The project utilizes Turtle for a simple GUI and Pandas to handle csv files. It adds names of regions that you haven't guessed yet into a separate file "regions_to_learn.csv".
Run main.py to start the program.
